### Hi there, I'm Karina!

I am currently attending programming [School 21](https://21-school.ru/) and taking online courses [Hexlet](https://ru.hexlet.io/) to become a backend developer.

**My favourite projects from the latest:**

- [Task Manager](https://github.com/KarinaAbd/python-project-52) which I developed on Django, using PostrgreSQL and deployed it on PaaS. It's a great feeling to use an app that you wrote yourself!
- [Generate Diff](https://github.com/KarinaAbd/python-project-50) finds the differences between two data structures. To solve the problem I had to become familiar with recursion, which threw up a problem that required me to understand recursion, which ... you get it :)
- My own implementations of the utilities: cat and grep. Unfortunately, according to school rules I can't show the code here, but believe me it's beautiful. And even dynamic memory is not trying to leak anymore.
